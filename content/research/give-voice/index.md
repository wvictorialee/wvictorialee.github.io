# Cover image
# To use, place an image named `featured.jpg/png` in your page's folder.
# Otherwise, specify the `filename` option to load an image from your `assets/media/` folder.
# Placement options: 1 = Full column width, 2 = Out-set, 3 = Screen-width
# Focal point options: Smart, Center, TopLeft, Top, TopRight, Left, Right, BottomLeft, Bottom, BottomRight
# Set `preview_only` to `true` to just use the image for thumbnails.
# Banner image - To display a full width banner image, the parameters below can be inserted towards the end of a page’s front matter. It is assumed that the image is located in your assets/media/ media library, so the full path in the example below will be assets/media/header.png
  # but it's not working! ugh
